I"√<p>Have you ever thought about how teams or google meet invites work?</p>

<p>Recently I was tasked with a social engineering engagement and a random thought crosses my mind, how meeting invites actually work and could I abuse it somehow.</p>

<p>Of course, it turns out someone already thought of that and this method had been used in the wild, but no one explains how it actually works.
Since I couldn‚Äôt find any blog that technically describes this attack I dig into it myself and in this blog post I will try to explain to you how it works and how you as a pentester/red teamer can include it into your offensive techniques.</p>

<h3 id="what-was-my-goal-for-this-phishing-attack">What was my goal for this phishing attack?</h3>

<p>Send a fake meeting invite and create a sense of urgency so the target doesn‚Äôt pay much attention and click my link which asks for credentials.</p>

<p>The usual use case for creating a teams meeting (in outlook) works like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>click the ‚ÄúNew teams meeting‚Äù button</li>
  <li>new email page opens with an email body pre-populated with teams template and meeting URL</li>
  <li>set meeting title and select attendees</li>
  <li>click send and magically your attendees receive a fancy looking email where they can accept or deny a meeting invite</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-what-actually-happened-and-why-does-this-invite-look-so-fancy">So what actually happened and why does this invite look so fancy?</h3>
<p>When you create a meeting invite you are simply sending a normal email with the iCalendar object as an attachment.
Depending on the receiver‚Äôs client and how it processes the iCalendar object, you get a fancy-looking email or just a simple email with an attachment.
In the image below you can see how it looks like when you receive teams meeting invite in protonmail.</p>

<h3 id="what-exactly-is-an-icalendar-object">What exactly is an iCalendar object?</h3>
<p>According to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) is a media type which allows users to store and exchange calendaring and scheduling information such as events, to-dos, journal entries, and free/busy information. Files formatted according to the specification usually have an extension of .ics‚Äù</p>

<p>iCalendar is supported by Outlook, Google calendar, Yahoo calendar, Apple calendar, and many more. 
In this post, I am focusing on outlook.</p>

<p>Below you can see the iCalendar object of the teams meeting invite. I have simply sent a meeting invite to my protonmail address and just downloaded it and read the attachment.</p>

<p>The basic thing to understand here is that every iCalendar object starts with the <em>‚ÄúBEGIN:VCALENDAR‚Äù</em> and ends with the <em>‚ÄúEND:VCALENDAR‚Äù</em>.
The meeting part is between <em>‚ÄúBEGIN:VEVENT‚Äù</em> and <em>‚ÄúEND:VEVENT‚Äù</em>. Inside your event, you specify so-called components. 
Usually, not all of the components are required and in my POC you can find a stripped-down ics file that contains only necessary ones. Most of the components are self-explained but I will mark off the most interesting ones.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZER</strong> - specifies meeting organizer name and email address. You can set any email and name here so it looks like the meeting invite is coming from that person.</p>

<p><strong>ATTENDEE</strong> - specifies meeting attendee. If you need more attendees you would have multiple ATTENDEE components. Keep in mind attendees won‚Äôt receive a meeting invite email, this is just for the display. You can easily fake that 30 persons attend the meeting when you actually send an email to a single target.</p>

<p><strong>X-MICROSOFT-SKYPETEAMSMEETINGURL</strong> - if you specify this component meeting reminder will have the ‚ÄúJoin Online‚Äù button displayed. Unfortunately, when clicked, it will try to open a specified URL via desktop teams application and fail.</p>

<p><strong>DTSTART, DTSTAMP, DTEND</strong> - specifies the time of the meeting and how long it lasts. I did a neat trick here and set the meeting start time to 5 minutes before the current time, that way it looks like you are late 5 minutes for the meeting. When the target receives an email, outlook processes it as a meeting invite, it seems that the meeting started 5 minutes ago and immediately displays a reminder on the screen. It helps encourage urgency.</p>

<p>The result looks like this:

<p>You can check out my POC at <a href="https://github.com/ExAndroidDev/fakemeeting/" target="_blank">github</a> and edit the script and templates to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Keed in mind I‚Äôve just showed how outlook handles the meeting invites. This should work on any email provider/client that processes ics attachements.</p>

<p>Then end!</p>
