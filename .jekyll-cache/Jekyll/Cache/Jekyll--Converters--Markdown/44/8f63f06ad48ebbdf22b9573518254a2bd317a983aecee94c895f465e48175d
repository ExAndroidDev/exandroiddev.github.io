I"`%<p>You have probably heard that Microsoft will soon disable macros in the documents that are coming from the internet (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked" target="blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked</a>). It got me thinking, what are the other alternatives to gain initial access to the target’s environment, what kind of payloads can we deliver?</p>

<p>While browsing Mitre’s att&amp;ck I have come across a pretty old technique, known as the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/002/" target="blank">right-to-left override attack (rtlo)</a> . If you have never heard of it, I will try to explain it briefly.
Some languages write from left to right side, like English and German for example. Some languages write from right to left side, like Arabic and Hebrew for example.
By default, Windows OS displays letters from left to right side but since it also supports other languages it supports writing from right to left side. There is a unicode character that flips the text to the right-to-left side (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u202E</code>) and you can combine it with the already existing text.
Basically, you can reverse text in file names and that way hide the true file extension.</p>

By default file extensions are hidden. I believe there is no point performing this type of extension spoofing if the target Windows OS is hidding file extensions.</em></h5>
<p><br />
I have written a simple <a href="https://github.com/ExAndroidDev/rtlo-attack" target="blank">tool</a> in c# that spoofs the extension of a desired executable as well as changes the icon to anything you specify.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-the-tool">How to use the tool?</h3>
<p>The tool accepts two arguments, the first one is the input executable and the second is the icon. Since I don’t know how to easily explain how to use my tool I will try to explain it through examples.</p>

<p>Firstly you need to rename your executable to suits the required format before passing it into the tool. 
	Make sure that extension you would like to spoof is the last part before the true extension. For example if you want to make a file look like “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.png</code>” make sure your executable name is something like “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple.exemple</code><strong>.png.</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exe</code>”.
Also, make sure that the true extension, let’s say it is “.exe” or “.scr”, is present in the filename, wheter in its true form or reversed “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exe.</code>” or “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rcs.</code>”. Like “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple</code><strong>.exe</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mple.png.exe</code>”. (More details on reversed extension below.)</p>

<p>Once you rename your executable to match the required format pass it to the tool as a first argument along with the desired icon. <br /></p>
<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./rtlo-attack.exe simple.exemple.png.exe png.ico
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/example-1.png" alt="example-1" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The tool works by taking the file extension, like in the previous example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exe</code> and finding the match inside the executable’s name. After the match is found, it adds rtlo and ltro characters to hide the actual extension and preserve the ordinary-looking name. If you are interested in more details take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ExAndroidDev/rtlo-attack/blob/main/Program.cs#L47">source code</a>.</p>

<h3 id="additional-obfuscation">Additional obfuscation</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned a few paragraphs above, you can also reverse the true file extension to obfuscate it even more. 
Let’s take a look at the next example. I am going to use “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.scr</code>” extension, since reversing “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exe</code>” doesn’t look much different.</p>
<h5 id="note-to-create-an-scr-executable-just-change-the-file-extension-from-exe-to-scr-and-the-executable-will-still-run"><em>Note: To create an “.scr” executable just change the file extension from “.exe” to “.scr” and the executable will still run.</em></h5>
<p><br />
So let’s rename an executable to meet filename format requirements before we pass it to the tool. Rename the executable to something like “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My-pictu</code><strong>rcs.</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">png.scr</code>” and pass it to the tool. Notice how we specified the true file extension but in reverse (“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rcs.</code>”) in the file name. After the tool has done it’s magic the resulting executable name will look like this “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My-picturcs.png</code>”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/example-2.png" alt="example-2" class="center-image" />
<br /></p>

<p>The other interesting way of obfuscation is chaging extension casing. Since Windows OS doesn’t care about lower or upper case, you can have an extension such as “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exE</code>”.
An example executable can look like this “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My</code><strong>.exE</strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvironment.png.exE</code>” and the output would end up looking like this: “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My.exEnvironment.png</code>”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/example-3.png" alt="example-3" class="center-image" />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="what-about-anti-virus">What about anti-virus?</h3>
<p>You might have noticed that some AVs, like Microsoft’s Defender for example, flags a file with rtlo character in its name. 
Fortunately someone has already done a research on that part. Thanks to the <a href="http://blog.sevagas.com/?Bypass-Defender-and-other-thoughts-on-Unicode-RTLO-attacks">http://blog.sevagas.com/?Bypass-Defender-and-other-thoughts-on-Unicode-RTLO-attacks</a>, he concluded that AV might flag the file if it contains a rtlo character and ends with a valid extension. I will summarize it below but I encourage you to read the article.</p>

<p>For example, if you spoof the file name to look like “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smth.executive.summary.txt</code>” it will be flagged by AV, but if the name is “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smth.executive.summary.blah</code>” it will not.
If only there is a way to make an extension look legit but is not actually valid…</p>

<p>Of course there is a way. Since we are already playing with different languages why wouldn’t we use letters from different aphabets.<br /> For example payload “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smth.executive.summary.txt</code>” is flagged by the AV, but “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smth.executive.summary.tхt</code>” is not since the “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>” (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u0445</code>) is not an actual latin letter “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>” (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u0078</code>) but an cyrilic version of letter “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code>”.  Simply copy/paste the unicode character from any unicode table website and paste it into file name and it will do the trick.</p>

For example you can’t change the icon of the “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bat</code>” or “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.com</code>” file types.</em></h5>

<h3 id="but-how-do-we-deliver-it">But how do we deliver it?</h3>
<p>One option would be to make your target download ZIP archive or ISO/VHD image. ISO image is automatically mounted to the Windows OS by simple double clicking it and since it is different system file format it would bypass so called mark-of-the-web (MOTW). But that is the content for the other post.</p>

<p>The End!</p>
